To run the re-implemented code:

1) Run LeNet model with Swish function in LeNet.py in dotPyfiles folder
2) For comparison, the ReLu function can also be used
3) Check if ReLu is being called anywhere and comment that out
4) Finally, run the kernel in Jupyter notebook (Final_Re_Imp.ipynb) with Python3.10 

**Disclaimer:  There are certain settings in the jupyter notebook that might need to be changed to reproduce results. I have uncommented the code that takes the least time to execute (~35 mins).
